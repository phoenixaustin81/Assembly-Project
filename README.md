# Assembly-Project
A project to showcase my assembly language skills.

This program generates 200 random numbers in the range [10 ... 29], displays the unsorted list, 
counts and displays the number of instances of each number, uses the list of counts to sort the 
list of random numbers, displays the median of the list, then finally displays the sorted list.

I ran this code in visual studio via a virtual machine, but the VM has sense been compromised,
and all I have left is the source code. The compiler, irvine32, and etc. files have all been lost.
Therefore, the purpose of this repository is only to showcase my assembly source code.
