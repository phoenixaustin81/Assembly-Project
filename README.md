# Assembly-Project
A project to showcase my assembly language skills.

This program generates 200 random numbers in the range [10 ... 29], displays the unsorted list, 
counts and displays the number of instances of each number, uses the list of counts to sort the 
list of random numbers, displays the median of the list, then finally displays the sorted list.

UPDATE: Soon, you will be able to run this code directly from your computer. As of now, none of
the dependencies (irvine.32, etc.) are included in this repository. Once I link my portfolio 
projects (such as this one) to my personal website, I will make them (including this one) more
accessible for users. What's the point of having source code that can't execute remotely? That's 
the problem I will soon tackle.
